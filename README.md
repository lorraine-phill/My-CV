Code Examples

| [360 Life] | [MoveMe App] | [LuckyCarmz Music] |
|:---------- |:------------ |:------------------ |
| Collaborated with [Deniss Bohanovs] and [Martin van de Loo] on a Rails based minimum viable product (MVP) that was completed over 10 days. The goal of the project was to move a popular paper-based "wheel of life" tool (used by life coaches and motivational trainers) to a digitized version that would be generated through the completion of an online questionnaire. Primary technologies included Rails 4.0, Ruby 2.0 and D3.js library. | Fully responsive website built using Bootstrap 3. The site utilizes Bootstrap’s grid system (containers, nested columns, offsets etc.), form features, nav bar features, dropdowns, buttons, toggable tabs, modals, tooltips, the accordion, carousel, thumbnails and glyphicons. | Fully responsive web design for an up-and-coming producer out of Miami hand-built from scratch using Photoshop, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery.|
